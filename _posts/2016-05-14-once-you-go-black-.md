Trends come and go, but there's one thing we can always count on - the chic and sultry stylings of a black ensemble!

It's no different with décor. We think the black and yellow combination at this birthday dinner works wonderfully together.The yellow adds warmth and the black adds depth and sophistication.Add a hint of white and you've got a fresh, morern look for a fashion forward lady (or gentleman for that matter)!
