We unleashed our inner retro chic with this houndstooth-inspired wedding we designed in Abuja! Houndstooth is a textile pattern characterised by duotone checks or abstract four-pointed shapes. We stuck with the classic black and white colour palette, which added a certain "je ne sais quoi" to the event.

The houndstooth lampshades on the walkway had a Chanel-esque quality, which was carried through to the stage decor.

The pattern was used sparingly against classic monochrome elements to make sure that it stood out. Hope you love it as much as we do!
